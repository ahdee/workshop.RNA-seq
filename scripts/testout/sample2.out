this is where my seqs are at: /asclab/users/leea3/workshop.RNA-seq/seq/
this is where my outputs will be: /asclab/users/leea3/workshop.RNA-seq/seq/testout/
this is where my input files are /asclab/users/leea3/workshop.RNA-seq/seq/test_R1.fastq.gz /asclab/users/leea3/workshop.RNA-seq/seq/test_R2.fastq.gz
this is what I'm calling it tt1
